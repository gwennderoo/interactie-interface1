					<h3>Legacy - Early 21st Century
					</h3>
					<p>"As I entered the early 21st century, my legacy as one of the richest ducks in the world was firmly established. 
						My financial empire had expanded into various industries, and my estimated net worth had reached astronomical levels. 
						While the exact figures may be a well-kept secret, it's safe to say that my fortune was measured in the hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars.”

						On the same day, I lost contact with my family and became the richest duck in the world. My fortune at that time was substantial, estimated in the billions.”
